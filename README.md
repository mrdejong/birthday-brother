# Birthday message thing for my brother

So on feb. 7th my brother will age from 29 to 30, yes I know he is getting old. Don't worry about it!

Since corona has taken the world by storm our government have setup some rules/laws that no one can have more 1 visitor. So that means I can't visit him and drink a cup of coffee with him with some birthday cake, I know right now I gotta buy the birthday cake myself that is sad :(. Anyways my brothers girlfriend wanted us (family and friends) to record a little video wishing him a happy birthday, now I can do that right that is easy. But I'm not about that I'll record just a little video in where I talk with the computer, and thus I need this script to say the lines I need the computer to say :)
